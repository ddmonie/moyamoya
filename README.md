Code poem and fractal art by Dileep D. Monie. Published in *The Tempest: Mayo Clinic Alix School of Medicine Annual Creative Arts Publication* (2021).

Moyamoya is a disease in which stenosed internal carotid arteries cause cerebral hypoperfusion, inducing compensatory neovascularization that resembles a “puff of smoke” on imaging. This poem is composed of valid Python code that uses variables, comments, and logic related to the pathogenesis of this disease as a metaphor for perseverance. The libraries imported have rich ties to both Mayo Clinic and neuroscience, with NumPy authored by Mayo Graduate School alumnus Travis Oliphant and Matplotlib by electrocorticography researcher John Hunter. When run in a Jupyter Notebook, this program outputs superimposed fractals derived from the Julia and Fatou sets—an artistic interpretation of moyamoya.
